* Algorithm Notes
** Breadth First Search(BFS)
   + Use a array or other data structure to record whether an element has been
     visited.
   + When extend an element, do not validate extended elements right away.
     Instead, validate elements only when visit them. Because we always use a
     data structure to record the visit status of an element, so we can make
     sure only validate an element at most once. If we validate the element when
     we extend to it, element will be validate multiple times and increase the
     time usage significantly.

** Flood fill 
   + You can flood fill with 4 directions or with 8 directions.

** Brute Force and Backtracking
   +
