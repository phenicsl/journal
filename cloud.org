** Appegine operating system and hardware
   There are ways to figure out what operating system or hardware a server is
   using, but in the end it doesn't matter: the runtime environment is an
   abstraction above the operating system that allows App Engine to manage
   resource allocation, computation, request handling, scaling, and load
   distribution without the application's involvement. 

** Static File Servers
   App Engine provides a separate set of servers dedicated to delivering static
   files. These servers are optimized for both internal architecture and network
   topology to handle requests for static resources. 

** Transaction
