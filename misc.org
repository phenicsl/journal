* Google Code with Mercurial
** Google Code
  + clone google code to local repository with
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  hg clone https://project-name.googlecode.com/hg/    
#+END_SRC
** Mercurial
  + Mercurial does not have the Index concept as git, so you could use /hg add/
    to add a new file to the repo, but /hg add/ is not appropriate to be used
    again when you update a file. In reverse, you should use /hg commit
    <filename>/ directly when update a file.
